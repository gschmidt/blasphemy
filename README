The bomb will not start a chain-reaction in the water converting it
all to gas and letting all the ships on all the oceans drop down to
the bottom. It will not blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the
water run down the hole. It will not destroy gravity. I am not an
atomic playboy, as one of my critics labeled me, exploding these bombs
to satisfy my personal whim.
